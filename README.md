# "brain-stem" neural network

This needs a really long description, with links to the relevant papers (2 or 3 short ones).<br>
<br>
Will eventually add a bash build script.<br>
Will eventually add a LeNet implementation for comparison.<br>
Will eventually add tensor reshaping and index swapping.<br>
Will eventually add faster Z3 operations.<br>
<br>
Probably won't do the bit packing for Z3 just yet. Don't need to think about that until I get to larger models, or running on specialized hardware.<br>
